## Understanding the Outputs

### 1. Performance Metrics

#### Basic Metrics
- **Total Duration**: Length of audio in seconds
- **Processing Time**: Time taken to process the audio
- **Real-time Factor**: Processing time / Audio duration (1.0 = real-time)
- **Total Segments**: Number of transcription segments
- **Segments per Minute**: Transcription density

#### Speaker Analysis
- **Speaker Distribution**: How much each speaker talked
- **Speaker Balance**: Ratio of least to most talkative speaker (1.0 = perfect balance)
- **Dominant Speaker**: Who talked the most

#### Content Analysis
- **Word/Character Counts**: Total and average per segment
- **Confidence Scores**: Average confidence of transcription
- **Quality Metrics**: Empty segments, short/long segments

### 2. Language Analysis

#### Language Distribution
- **English**: English language segments
- **Chinese**: Chinese language segments  
- **Numbers**: Numeric content
- **Punctuation**: Punctuation marks

#### Mixed Language Detection
- **Mixed Segments**: Segments containing multiple languages
- **Mixing Percentage**: % of segments with language mixing
- **Examples**: Sample mixed language segments

### 3. Conversation Flow

#### Turn-taking Analysis
- **Speaker Switches**: Number of times speakers changed
- **Average Turn Length**: Average segments per speaker turn
- **Quick Switches**: Rapid speaker changes (< 2 seconds)
- **Interruption Rate**: % of quick switches
- **Conversation Pace**: Segments per minute

### 4. Extracted Information

#### Key Data Extraction

- **Long Segments**: Segments with > 20 words

## Input File Format

The tool expects a JSON file with this structure:
```json
{
  "session_info": {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-14T10:31:25.254832",
    "audio_file": "converted_audio.wav",
    "processing_time": "0:15:37.797119"
  },
  "segments": [
    {
      "timestamp": "00:00:06.919",
      "speaker": "mysteryshopper",
      "text": "This is dream car today is september 2024 is around 10 am. I'm meeting",
      "raw_data": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output File Format

The detailed analysis report includes:
```json

  "source_file": "transcription_results/transcription_20250714_103125.json",
  "performance_metrics": {
    "basic_metrics": {...},
    "speaker_analysis": {...},
    "content_analysis": {...},
    "quality_metrics": {...}
  },
  "language_analysis": {...},
  "conversation_flow": {...},
  "extracted_information": {...}
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Call Center Quality Assessment

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use High-Quality Audio**: Better audio = better transcription = better analysis
2. **Check Speaker Labels**: Ensure speaker diarization is accurate
3. **Review Confidence Scores**: Low confidence may indicate transcription errors
4. **Consider Context**: Some metrics may vary by conversation type
5. **Compare Multiple Files**: Use for benchmarking and trend analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **File Not Found**: Ensure JSON file path is correct
- **Invalid JSON**: Check that transcription file is properly formatted
- **No Segments**: Verify transcription contains actual content
- **Memory Issues**: Large files may require more memory

### Performance Notes
- Analysis time scales with file size
- Large files (>100MB) may take several minutes
- Consider using summary mode for quick checks
